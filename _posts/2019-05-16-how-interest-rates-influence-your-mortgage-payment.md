As a homebuyer, your interest rate can dramatically affect your mortgage payment and the interest you pay over the life of your loan.&nbsp;

For example, if you have a $300,000 loan with a 4.25% interest rate, your principal and interest payments would be roughly $1,475 per month. That means, for a 30-year mortgage where you pay minimum scheduled payments over the life of the loan, you’d pay $231,295 worth of interest.&nbsp;

Now, if you went from a 4.25% interest rate to a 5.25% interest rate for the same loan, your payment would increase by $227 per month—or $82,000 over the life of the loan.&nbsp;

The good news is, interest rates have dropped significantly over the last month, so **whether you’re thinking of buying your first home or refinancing your current home, now is the time to act.&nbsp;**
