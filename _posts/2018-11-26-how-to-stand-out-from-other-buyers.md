When it comes time to submit an offer on a home, how can you ensure that you stand out above the competition? Actually, there are five main tips I recommend you use to catch the seller’s eye.&nbsp;

**1. Make the strongest offer possible.** It sounds obvious, but if you really want to secure a home, you need to put your best foot forward. Buyers tend to only look at the very best properties within their search criteria. With that in mind, it only makes sense that the quality of your offer must match the quality of the home you’re interested in. Lowballing a seller will very rarely reap positive results. Don’t be afraid to make an offer at or above list price. Getting a good deal is great, but getting the home you want is even more important.&nbsp;

**2. Have your agent write up tight-but-realistic deadlines.** Sellers don’t want to waste their time working with a buyer they don’t believe is serious.&nbsp;

**3. Use earnest money to your advantage.** A strong earnest money deposit will show the seller that you’re serious about buying their home. Better yet, your earnest money will be credited toward your down payment at closing, so don’t be afraid to increase the amount of your deposit if doing so will help you secure the home.&nbsp;

**4. Help the seller feel good about your offer.** Sellers don’t always choose the very highest offer. Sometimes, they choose the offer they feel best about. Buyers and sellers are both making emotional decisions throughout the real estate process, so taking small actions like including a personal letter or family photo with your offer can go a long way.&nbsp;

**5. Give the seller time to move out.** Moving is stressful for buyers and sellers, so giving them a little extra time after closing to move out will help them out and speak volumes about your offer. Sometimes I'll even suggest offering a short-term leaseback to the seller as well.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
