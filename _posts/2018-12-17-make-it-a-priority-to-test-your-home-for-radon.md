Radon is a gaseous substance that forms in the earth and can infiltrate the foundation of a home. It’s very dangerous and is currently the No. 2 leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S.&nbsp;

**Due to its colorless and gasless nature, many homeowners aren’t even aware of it when radon gas happens to be in their home.** The EPA estimates that one in every 15 homes in the U.S. has elevated levels of radon gas. I can speak from experience as I recently had my home tested, and the levels were high enough, it warranted having a mitigation system installed. To preserve the health and safety of you and your family, **it’s important to have your home tested for the presence of radon.**
