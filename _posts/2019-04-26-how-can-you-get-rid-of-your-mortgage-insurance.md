If you bought a home and put down less than 20% for it, how can you get rid of your mortgage insurance?
{: .present-before-paste}

First, let’s examine where mortgage insurance comes from. **Homes with less than 20% equity are more risky for banks,** so if a homeowner allows their home to be foreclosed on by not making payments, the bank’s private mortgage insurance will kick in and pay out so they don’t lose as much money on it.&nbsp;

If you get a conventional loan with less than 20% down, it’s referred to as “private mortgage insurance.” If you get an FHA loan, it’s just called “mortgage insurance.”

To get rid of it on a conventional loan, **you can get a new appraisal and show that you have at least 20% equity in your property.&nbsp;**

For FHA loans, any loan completed prior to June 3, 2013 requires at least 20% of its balance to be paid off in order to drop the mortgage insurance. Any FHA loans completed after this date require mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. If you find yourself in this situation, you may need to refinance if you want to get rid of your mortgage insurance.&nbsp;
