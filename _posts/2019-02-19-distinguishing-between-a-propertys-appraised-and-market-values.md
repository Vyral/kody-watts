So what exactly is the difference between appraised value and market value?

**A property’s appraised value is used by banks to determine a fair value to lend to a person interested in purchasing that property.** Real estate appraisers determine appraised value by comparing recently sold properties with similar features to the home in question and that are located in the same area.

**Market value is what a buyer is willing to pay for a property**; this can sometimes be higher or lower than its appraised value. Buyers determine market value by comparison shopping—they’re only choosing the very best properties that fit their needs, price range, and location.&nbsp;

**Market value can be increased because of multiple offers or very low competing inventory.** However, it can also be decreased, like when buyers have too many homes to choose from. When the market value for a property is higher than its appraised value, it will oftentimes cause problems for sellers, because banks will only lend up to the appraised value for a property.
