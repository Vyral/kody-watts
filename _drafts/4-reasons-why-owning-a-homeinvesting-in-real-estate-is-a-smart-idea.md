Here are the four main reasons why owning a home and/or investing in real estate is a great idea:

**1. Your property will appreciate over time.** On average, home values have appreciated by about 4% per year over the last 30 years. For a $300,000 home, that’s an increase of $12,000 per year. Here in Utah, homes appreciated last year by an average of 14%, which equates to $42,000 for a $300,000 home.

**2. Your mortgage acts as a forced savings account.** Every single month, you’re making a mortgage payment and paying down the principal balance of your loan. For example, if you pay $600 per month, that’s $7,200 of equity gained over an entire year.

**3. You can take advantage of unique tax savings.** Owning real estate is a great tax shelter. Whether you’re writing off the mortgage interest on your primary residence or depreciating your investment property, this shows less taxable income to the IRS, which saves you money.

**4. Investment properties create additional cash flow.** You can rent out your investment property for more than what your monthly expenses cost. Here in the U.S., the average renter has a total net worth of $5,200, whereas the average homeowner has a net worth of $232,000.

At the end of the day, owning real estate is simply a smart investment. If you have any more questions about buying a home or investing in real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to talk to you.
